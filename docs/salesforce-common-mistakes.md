# Salesforce Common Mistakes

## Here are 7 common mistakes to avoid when using Salesforce

### - You are not keeping the data clean

It’s important to keep your data clean and up-to-date in Salesforce. This means deduplicating records, removing inactive records, and making sure all data is accurate and consistent. `Data migration` and `cleaning` are always necessary when using Salesforce CRM for the first time in your organization. There is a good probability that crucial data will be spread over several digital platforms, and you will need to move it to a centralized platform in order to effectively launch Salesforce.

It would be challenging to remedy errors after the implementation is finished if you choose the wrong data or only a portion of the crucial data for migration. Making sure your database is completely clean and free of duplicate data is also crucial. Even though certain powerful Salesforce data cleansing solutions could assist you in getting back on track, your accuracy will ultimately be the deciding factor. Incorrect data would ultimately result in inaccurate results being provided by different Salesforce features, defeating the entire purpose of obtaining an automatic CRM system.

### - You are not using the right tools

Salesforce has a wide range of tools and features, and it’s important to use the right ones for your specific needs. For example, if you’re using Salesforce for `lead management`, you should use the `Lead` object and related features rather than trying to use the `Account` object. This is something that Salesforce developers regularly undertake to learn as much as they can about the resources available online.

### - You are not using custom fields and objects

`Custom fields` and `custom objects` allow you to tailor Salesforce to your specific business processes and needs. Although it can be difficult to keep up with new resources and advances in the developing sector, As a result, it’s crucial to keep programming procedures consistent. Use the latest technical developments, implementations, and libraries as well. Don’t be afraid to use them; they can make a big difference in the usefulness of Salesforce for your organization.

### - You are not training users

It’s important to properly train all users on Salesforce, including how to enter and maintain data, use features and tools, and follow best practices. Salesforce may appear to be a simple CRM platform, but there are some features and functions that your team members may find difficult to use. If you ignore this and assume your employees will become comfortable with the platform once it is established, you are making a serious mistake.

As a result, it is crucial to make proper plans for educating your employees on how to make the most of the Salesforce platform. Your members of the team will require some time to adjust to some specific platform features that may seem challenging to them. If you are switching from `Salesforce Classic` to the more recent `Salesforce Lightning`, this situation could occur frequently. Never forget to provide your sales team with enough theoretical and hands-on training so they can use Salesforce CRM as effectively as possible.

### - You are not following data governance policies
It’s important to have clear data governance policies in place to ensure that data is entered and maintained correctly in Salesforce. This includes things like who can access and edit data, how data is shared, and how data security is maintained. An effective Salesforce deployment is not actually possible without a clear vision, according to every Salesforce implementation guide. Don’t ever make the error of purchasing Salesforce in a rush.

Prior to beginning the implementation, it is crucial to have well-defined objectives and an effective vision. Decide which areas you need to focus on and which essential company activities you need to automate with Salesforce CRM. This would enable you to narrow your attention to the areas of your business that are most crucial and assist you in making crucial business decisions.

### - You are not using automation

Salesforce offers a range of automation features, such as `workflow rules and processes`, that can help streamline business processes and reduce the need for manual data entry. Installing Salesforce CRM doesn’t often appear to be a difficult task because most of the work is done by developers, and every other function and tool of the platform is extremely customizable. If you believe you can manage the implementation alone and don’t need to consult anyone before doing the same, you should rethink your position.

Even if you are certain of the services you want to use and the business procedures you must manage, you should still seek advice from others. It is crucial to talk to everyone on the team who will be using the platform and get their feedback on how to implement it. It’s also crucial to heed the advice of your superiors because they’ll have a better and more comprehensive understanding of the industry. Make sure to take advantage of these features to improve efficiency.

### - You are not customizing dashboards and reports

`Custom dashboards and reports` allow you to see the data that is most important to your business and track key metrics. Take the time to customize these to meet your specific needs. The notion that Salesforce CRM is a fully customizable platform is one of its most significant and advantageous characteristics. Because every firm is unique, so are its needs, demands, and business strategies. It is crucial to avoid assuming that Salesforce can be implemented in your company without requiring any modifications.

Despite having a wide range of features and tools to support both small and large business activities, the majority of these functions are set at standard levels, making it impossible for you to fully utilize the platform until you customize Salesforce for your particular business organization. When that happens, your only choice will be to modify your business procedures to fit the offerings offered by Salesforce CRM, which is as absurd as it sounds! So, it is preferable to customize the Salesforce platform rather than invest a lot of effort in redesigning your business operations.

### - Final Thoughts

These are some of the primary errors that, in general, prevent a correct and effective Salesforce integration and result in a major project failure. However, these faults can be prevented by creating a clear strategy that will guarantee your company’s success. If you want to offer high-quality Salesforce integration services, be creative and use cutting-edge ideas to wisely integrate Salesforce with your products while avoiding frequent blunders.
