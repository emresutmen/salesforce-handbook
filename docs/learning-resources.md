> **Note**: As you learn the technical skills on Trailhead, build solutions to everyday business problems in a Trailhead Playground. For example, build a web-to-lead form that captures specific data points from prospective customers and pushes them into Salesforce. Then, build some automation of what should happen once the lead is submitted. This way, youâ€™ll get hands-on experience to transform an idea into a working solution. (2 months)
